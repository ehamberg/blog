In case anyone is interested:

I made a simple Plasmoid for viewing coming events from Google Calendar. It's
simply a webview showing the iPhone version of Google Calendar.  It's written in
Python and took 10 minutes to write (27 lines of code) by following [the
excellent tutorial on
techbase](http://techbase.kde.org/Development/Tutorials/Plasma/Python/GettingStarted).

You can download it here:

If you improve it or make another Google Calendar plasmoid: let me know! :)

Oh, btw. To install it run `plasmapkg -i gcal.zip`.

P.S: openSuse users: I had to install `python-dev` to actually run a python plasmoid. Don't know why.
