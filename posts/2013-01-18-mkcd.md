So, how often do you `mkdir` a directory without `cd`'ing into right after?
Sure, it *does* happen, but not very often. Which is why I have the following
`mkcd` command in my `.zshrc`:

```bash
mkcd () {
    mkdir -p "${1}"
    cd "${1}"
}
```

I was reminded of this again when setting up a new machine (in the few minutes
before I had cloned my *dotfiles* repository). So, if you want to save some
seconds of `cd`'ing into newly created directories, add the code above to your
`.bashrc`/`.zshrc` and `alias` `mkdir` to `echo "no. use 'mkcd'."` for the first
few days.
