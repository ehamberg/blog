I have now been in Portland, Oregon for two weeks. I moved here to do an
internship at [galois](http://www.galois.com) and it has been great so far. It's
a quite small city (pop: ~600 000) and it's really pedestrian and bike friendly
– quite uncommon for an American city. I live by
[Alberta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta_Street,_Portland,_Oregon) which
is a neighbourhood full of small shops, cafés and pubs, and it's always fun to
walk around and see what's happening.

Close to downtown Portland is the beautiful [Forest
Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_Park_(Portland,_Oregon)) with lots of
really nice trails where you can walk in beautiful, lush, green forest, just 15
minutes from the city centre.

Oh, and the beer scene… There are lots of great breweries in the area, and most
of them have brew pubs in Portland. So far, my favourite is
[Deschutes](http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/)'s [Red
Chair](http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/brew/red-chair-nw-pale-ale) – an amazing
pale ale with a well-rounded but distinct taste. (Seriously, try it!)

I'm sure I have barely scratched the surface, and am looking forward to
exploring more. :-)
