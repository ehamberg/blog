title: Github Needs a Better Way to “Bookmark” Projects
description: Suggestions on how to improve Github's notifications

I often get excited about new projects quite early, often after seeing them
being mentioned on Hacker news or by seeing my friends' activity on Github.
These projects are frequently in the "promising, but not yet stable" category
and even though I often don't want to -- or have the time to -- get involved
that early, I at least want to keep an eye on the project as it develops.

Github has always had functionality to do this with its concept of "watching" a
project, but the problem is that this scales very poorly. If you watch more than
a handful of active projects, your news feed will quickly become a raging
torrent -- making it hard to see updates from less active projects and your
Github friends.

I wish Github had a notification system that at least separated the two use
cases of wanting to "bookmark" a repository vs tracking everything that happens
to a repository that I want to watch closely. What I suggest is the following:

- What is now called "watch" should be called "monitor" -- or something else
  that clearly implies that this will automatically put *everything* that
  happens to that repository in your news feed.
- Having "watch" mean that you are added on a list of interested users the
  repository owner can send a message to when a new version is released or
  there are other news about the project.

In this way, it will be easier to "bookmark" repositories on Github and only
get the "big" updates for these projects.

Another idea would be to make which notifications to receive configurable on a
project to project (well, repository to repository) basis, so that you could,
e.g. only see new tags or new issues for a given project.
