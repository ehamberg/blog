Kate's maintainer, Christoph Cullmann, shared a funny story over a beer one of
the first days here at GCDS.

In ye olden days, what is now Kate and Kwrite was one application called "KWrite
-- KDE's Advanced Text Editor". However, the author of Kwrite mysteriously
disappeared. Christoph forked Kwrite and continued working on it and after some
time it greatly surpassed Kwrite's capabilities and was becoming more of a power
tool. A name change was long overdue.  Being a good German, Christoph decided to
name it after the philosopher Immanuel Kant, so in KDE 2.1 the editor "Kant" was
born.  For some strange reason, probably easier to understand for native English
speakers, it was renamed to "Kate" in KDE 2.2. And thus was what still is KDE's
Advanced Text Editor was born.
