title: Vim tip: Highlight Function Names in C Code

When looking at function signatures such as

    EXPORT _foo_bar_handle_restricted _foo_common_alloc_restricted( â€¦ )

it's often hard to quickly see what the function name is among all the spaces
and underscores. To help with this, many editors support highlighting function
names. Vim can also do this, e.g. by using a tags file, but for large code bases
this can be quite slow. The following syntax definitions use a simple heuristic
to highlight function names in C code by making their names boldface. In my
experience it works quite well.

(The original version came from [a stackoverflow
answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/736701/class-function-names-highlighting-in-vim/773392#773392),
but Albert Lee posted a better version in the comments.)

```vim
" Highlight Function names
syn match cCustomFunc /\w\+\s*(/me=e-1,he=e-1
hi def link cCustomFunc Function
```

To use this, put it in `~/.vim/after/syntax/c/highlight_functions.vim`. (All
files in `~/.vim/after/syntax/[filetype]/` will be sourced when vim opens a file
of type `[filetype]`.)
