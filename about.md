# Hi.

I'm Erlend. I completed a master's degree in computer science at
[NTNU](http://www.ntnu.edu) in 2011 and currently work as a software engineer at
[Comoyo](http://www.comoyo.com) in Trondheim, Norway. I have previously worked
as an engineer for [ARM](http://www.arm.com) in their office in Trondheim,
Norway and as a research intern for [Galois](http://www.galois.com) in Portland,
OR.

I like to play around with [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org) and various other
technologies. See my [projects](/projects.html) page for an overview.
