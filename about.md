# Hi.

I'm Erlend. I completed a master's degree in computer science at
[NTNU](http://www.ntnu.edu) in 2011 and currently work as a research intern at
[Galois](http://www.galois.com) in Portland, OR. I previously worked for
[ARM](http://www.arm.com) in their office in Trondheim, Norway.

I like to play around with [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org) and various other
technologies. See my [projects](/projects.html) page for an overview.
