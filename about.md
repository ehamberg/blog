# Hi.

I'm Erlend. I completed a master's degree in computer science at
[NTNU](http://www.ntnu.edu) in 2011 and currently work for
[ARM](http://www.arm.com) in their office in Trondheim, Norway where I work on
the driver for the
[Mali-400](http://www.arm.com/products/multimedia/mali-graphics-hardware/mali-400-mp.php)
GPU.

When not writing C code for work I like to play around with
[Haskell](http://www.haskell.org) and various other technologies. See my
[projects](/projects.html) page for an overview.
