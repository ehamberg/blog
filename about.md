# Hi.

I'm Erlend. I currently work as a software engineer at
[Soundrop](http://www.soundrop.fm) in Oslo, Norway. I have previously worked at
[Comoyo](http://www.comoyo.com) and [ARM](http://www.arm.com) in Trondheim,
Norway and as a research intern for [Galois](http://www.galois.com) in
Portland, OR.

I like to play around with [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org) and various other
technologies. See my [projects](/projects.html) page for an overview.
